          <p>ross and ash walk to work together and have a morning date at least once a week. one morning they were up early, so ross suggested they have a long breakfast and coffee date at our favorite places. ross asked ashley to walk by the water and she thought man, this is such a great morning - she wished every day could start like this. little did she know that it was going to get even better...</p>
          <p>ross said he had to tie his shoe and when ashley looked at him to see why he was down there so long, he was on one knee, ring in hand and asked to if she'd marry him. they sat on a bench for awhile soaking it all in and now they have their special bench that they walk by every day.</p>
